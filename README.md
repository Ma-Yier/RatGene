# RatGene

Growth to production ratio-based design algorithms for constraint-based metabolic networks for growth-coupled production: RatGene


## Introduction
A ratio-based generalized approach that is capable of fulfilling a variety of modification criteria at both the gene and reaction levels. Additionally, RatGene also delivers the results with reduced-size strategies for the deletion or addition on both gene levels.
